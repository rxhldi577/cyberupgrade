# Copla Compliance Platform: Automate 95% of Security Tasks, Save €60,000+ Annually

Running a business today means juggling compliance frameworks like ISO 27001, DORA, NIS2, and SOC 2. It's exhausting. Most companies spend hundreds of hours manually collecting evidence, creating policies, and preparing for audits—time that could be spent building their actual product.

Here's the thing though: it doesn't have to be this way.

Copla (formerly known as CyberUpgrade) is an AI-powered compliance automation platform that claims to automate up to 95% of your security and compliance workload. The Lithuania-based company, founded in 2018, has rebranded in 2025 to reflect its evolved mission: transforming paper compliance into actual operational resilience.

## What Makes Copla Different?

Unlike traditional compliance tools that just give you checklists and templates, Copla actually does the work for you. The platform combines automation with fractional CISO services, meaning you get both the software and expert human guidance without the six-figure salary of a full-time Chief Information Security Officer.

The secret sauce is their AI-powered Copilot that integrates directly with your existing tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams. Instead of forcing your team to log into yet another platform, Copla meets them where they already work. The AI chatbot (called Copla Stream) guides employees through compliance tasks, collects evidence automatically, and keeps everything organized for when auditors come knocking.

## The Real Numbers Behind the Platform

According to Copla and verified user reviews, businesses using the platform typically see:

- **80-95% reduction** in manual compliance workload
- **€60,000+ annual savings** in compliance costs
- **24/7 audit-readiness** without the last-minute scramble
- **3x faster** compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

These aren't just marketing claims. Companies like Axiology and Evergrowth have publicly shared how Copla helped them achieve ISO 27001 certification in record time while dramatically reducing their team's workload.

## What Users Actually Say

Based on verified G2 reviews and case studies:

**The Good:**
- "The structured workflows help minimize mistakes and ensure we follow best practices. Other platforms offered instructions but didn't guide us through execution. Copla actually completes tasks accurately and efficiently."
- "We've significantly reduced expenses on external consultants while maintaining accuracy. Copla struck the perfect balance for our needs."
- "The dashboards give me real-time visibility across frameworks. I can easily identify bottlenecks and risk buildups."

**The Challenges:**
- Some users mention the initial setup can be time-consuming for larger organizations
- A few reviewers note that the user interface could use improvement
- Integration options, while growing, are still somewhat limited compared to enterprise platforms

**Overall Rating:** 4.9/5 on G2 (based on 78+ verified reviews)

## Who Should Use Copla?

This platform makes sense if you're:

**Fintech Companies:** Managing DORA, PCI DSS, or other financial regulations while trying to move fast

**Healthcare Providers:** Dealing with HIPAA requirements without a dedicated compliance team

**SaaS Startups:** Needing SOC 2 or ISO 27001 to close enterprise deals

**SMEs in Europe:** Facing NIS2 requirements but lacking internal security expertise

**MSPs (Managed Service Providers):** Managing compliance for multiple clients

It's probably not the right fit if you're a massive enterprise with complex, highly customized compliance needs that require deep integration with legacy systems.

## How Copla Compares to Alternatives

While platforms like Vanta, Drata, Sprinto, and Thoropass offer similar compliance automation, Copla's differentiators are:

1. **Higher automation rate** - The 95% claim is among the highest in the industry
2. **Fractional CISO included** - Most competitors charge extra for expert guidance
3. **European focus** - Strong support for EU-specific frameworks like DORA and NIS2
4. **Integration with communication tools** - The Slack/Teams integration is more seamless than competitors

## Getting Started with Copla

The typical onboarding process looks like this:

1. **Initial Consultation** - Free demo to assess your compliance needs
2. **Framework Selection** - Choose your primary framework (ISO 27001, DORA, etc.)
3. **Compliance Analysis** - Copla reviews your current processes and identifies gaps
4. **Evidence Collection** - Automated gathering from your existing systems
5. **Risk Assessment** - AI-powered evaluation of your security posture
6. **Documentation Setup** - Policies and procedures auto-generated
7. **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing compliance maintenance

The whole process typically takes 4-8 weeks for initial certification, compared to 6-12 months using traditional methods.

## Is Copla Worth It?

Let's do the math. If you're currently:
- Spending 400-800 hours per year on compliance (industry average)
- Paying €120,000-€180,000 for a compliance officer
- Risking fines up to 4% of global revenue for non-compliance

Then Copla's pricing of €3,500-€4,500/year starts to look like a bargain. Even with the fractional CISO add-on (€24,000/year), you're still saving over €100,000 annually compared to hiring a full-time security executive.

The platform isn't perfect—no automated tool can completely replace human judgment in complex security decisions. But for organizations that need to achieve and maintain compliance without building an entire security department, it's one of the most compelling options on the market in 2026.

## Current Promotions & How to Get Started

**January 2026 Special:**
- ISO 27001 framework: **€2,999** (save €1,001 from regular price)
- Get **20% off any additional frameworks** when you bundle
- Free onboarding consultation (€499 value) with annual plans

The platform offers a 30-day evaluation period and the team is generally responsive to custom pricing requests for larger organizations.
